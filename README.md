This is a Nextjs project with bi-directional scope:
1. Explore langchain cpabilities: start with several steps (upload a pdf to supabase, enable pg vector, create buckets and documents chunks and embeddings) and complete with final target, load many pdf files and chat about their content.
2. Upgrade to app folder (Nextjs 13): first create pages components with getStaticProps and getServerSideProps with which we are familiar, and then migrate each one to app folder to deeply understand the difference of each concept!
